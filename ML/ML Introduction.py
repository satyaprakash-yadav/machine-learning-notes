# Introduction To Machine Learning :-
# Why we learn ML ?

# Example we create utube recommendations 
# let create a recommendation engine for a user who watches videos on Youtube on a daily basis.in

# we can consider           | 
# these rules               |
#                           ● 01 show 10% Music Related content
#                           |
#                           |
#                           ● 02 show 20% Gaming Related content 
#                           |
#                           |
#                           ● 03 show 30 % Education Related content
#                           |
#                           |
#                           ● 04 show 40% Other Sort of content


# Classifier means classification of user to categories which types of content user want or likes .

# Why Python For ML  
# 1). Python is easy.
# 2). Python is fast enough.
# 3). Python has ML libraries.
# 4). Python is cross platform.


# Advantages, scope & future :-
# Teaching computers using data 
# Feeding data & instructing machine on what to do and how to behave.

# first search alpha go open wikip, machine learning algorithm se train ki gyi machine ne ek world champion ko hara diya 
# Machine learning algorithm getting input as features and giving labels as output.

# e.g candidate hiring data :-
#  ML yes/no (f1)   | Programming knownledge yes/no (f2)    | CGPA perc(f3) | comm skill(f4)  |     Hire = 0 (L1), No Hire = 1 (L2)
#        yes        |           yes                         |   7.8         |   excellent     |             0
#        no         |           yes                         |   6.6         |    good         |             1
#                   |                                       |               |                 |
