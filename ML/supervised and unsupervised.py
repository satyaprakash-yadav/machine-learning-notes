# ML with problem understanding 

# In machine learning , data and technique is important but equally important identifying
# the type of problem (Supervised and Unsupervised) 

# Steps in a typical machine learning problem 
# |  
# ● 1). Problem Identifying 
# |
# ● 2). Data Collection and Validation 
# |
# ● 3). Model Building   
# |
# ● 4). Feedback
# 

# what is Supervised learning ?
# Machine knows something beforehand 

# 1). Already Tagged Data
# 2). Features and Labels present 
# 3). Classification :- Classify which label a given set of features belong to. (e.g. apple , orange, mango image)
# 4). Regression :- Find out the value of the label using previous data. (value assume seen the data)


# what is Unsupervised learning ?
# All machine knows is the data in front of it. No features! No labels
# Machine seeing the data for the first time.

# 1). Data Not Already Tagged Data
# 2). Features and Labels not present 
# 3). Training not done
# 4). Clustering  :- Discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior. (e.g. In One class there good std, average std and failure we have to count & ident)
# and association :- Association rule learning problem. such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.
